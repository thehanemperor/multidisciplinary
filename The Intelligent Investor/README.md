# The Intelligent Investor
The most famous investing bible by Ben Graham. Most contents from the book might be awared already. I'll write down notes worth to revisit

## Chapter 8 -- The Investor and Market Fluctuations
#### Timing, forecasting?
- The investor can scarcely take seriously the innumerable predictions which appear almost daily and are his for the asking. However, he pays attention to them and even acts upon them. Why? Because he has been persuaded that it is important for him to form some opinion of the future couse of the stock market, *and because he feels that the brokerage or service forecast is at least more dependable than his own.* ðŸ¤¡

#### Buy Low Sell High? 
* classic defination of a "shrewd investor" was "one who bought in a bear market when everyone else was selling, and sold out in a bull market when everyone else was buying" Its just unrealistic, to wait for demonstrable bear-market levels before buying any common stocks. Our recommended policy has, however, made provision for changes in the *proportion* of common stocks to bonds in the portfolio, if the investor chooses to do so, according as the level of stock prices appears less or more attractive by value standards.

#### Market Fluctuations
* A serious investor is not likely to believe that the day-to-day or even month-to-month fluctuations of the stock market make him richer or poorer

#### Business Valuations vs Stock-Market Valuations
- The development of stock market in recent decades has made the typical investor **more dependent** on the course of price quotations and **less free** than formerly to consider himself merely a business owner.
    - Successful enterprises in his holdings sell at prices well above their net asset value. In paying these market premiums the investor gives precious hostages to fortune, for he must depend on the stock market itself to validate his commitments.
    - in short, the market decides the value

- stock-market quotations contains a built-in contradiction.
    - The better a company's record and prospects, the less relationship the price of its shares will have to their book value
    - The greater the premium above book value, the less certain the basis of determining its intrinsic value, the more this "value" will depend on the changing moods and measurements of the stock market. 
    - The better the quality of a common stock, the more *speculative* it is likely to be

- Selection of the portfolio, concentrate on issues selling at a reasonaly close to their tangible-asset value. not more than 1/3 above.

- A stock does **NOT** become a sound investment merely because it can be bought at close to its asset value. Trash is trash anyway. 
    - satisfactory ratio of earnings to price, a sstrong financial position, and the prospect that its earnings will at least be maintained over the years.

Summary: a stock portfolio having such book values behind it can take a much more independent and detached view of stock-market fluctuations than those who have paid high multipliers of both earnings and tangible assets.

#### A. & P. company exmaple
1. The stock market often goes far wrong, and sometimes an alert and courageous investor can take advantage of its patent errors.
2. Most business change in character and quality over years, sometimes for the better, perhaps more often for the **worse**

**Important: The true investor scarcely ever is forced to sell his shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard the current price quotation. He need pay attention to it and act upon it only to the extent that the price is favorable enough to justify selling the stock. Thus the investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage. That man would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at all, for he word then be spared the mental anguish caused him by other persons' mistakes of judgment**
