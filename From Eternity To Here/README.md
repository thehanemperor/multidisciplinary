# FROM ETERNITY TO HERE
This is to record mind blown physics COMMON knowledge

## Time is personal
*special relativity*:
- No local expeiment can distinguish between observers moving at constant velocities
- The speed of light is the same to all observers  
This basically means that the *speed of light* is constant, independent of the motion of experimenter
> Experiment: You are in your spaceship, and a friend in faraway spaceship is beaming a flashlight at you. You measure the velocity of the light from the flashlight, and the answer is 300,000 kilometers per second. Now you fire your rockets and accelerate toward your friend, until your relative velocity is 200,000 kilometers per second. you again measure the speed of light coming from the flashlight, and the answer is: 300,000 km/s.  
> Answer: according to special relativity, it's not the speed of light that depends on your *reference frame* - it's your notion of a "kilometer" and a "second". 
> - If a meterstick passes by us at high velocity, it undergoes "length contraction" -- it appears shorter than the meterstick that is sitting at rest in our reference frame. 
> - Likewise, if a clock moves by us at high velocity, it undergoes "time dilation" -- it appears to be ticking more slowly than the clock that is sitting at rest. 

Why can't the rocket reach the light speed?
1. Relativistic Mass Increases with Speed
    $$
    m = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
    $$



    - $m_0$: rest mass (mass when stationary)  
    - $v$: velocity of the object      
    - $c$: speed of light  

As $v$ approaches $c$, the denominator gets closer and closer to zero, making $m$ approach infinity.

2. Relativistic Energy
$$
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
$$

3. Only Massless Particles Can Travel at Light Speed
    - Particles like photons (light particles) have zero rest mass.

    - They always move at the speed of light in a vacuum.

    - Anything with even a tiny bit of mass will never reach $c$
